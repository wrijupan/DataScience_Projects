# Data Science and Machine Learning projects

This repository contains some independent Data Science projects that I have been working on recently. The tasks involve a wide range of topics including the following domains-

1. Unsupervised Deep Learning acoustic anomaly detection using an Autoencoder-based approach.

2. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to build models for classifying images along with building customised training loops.

3. Supervised Machine Learning Regression Task

4. Supervised classification task along with a treatment of highly imbalanced class labels in multi-class target variable.

5. Signal processing

More projects are currently under development and will be added to this repository soon.

# Methods

The projects described above cover the following methods mainly:

1. Importing data
2. Visualizing and exploring data
3. Data cleaning
4. Feature engineering
5. Encoding and treating outliers
6. Building Machine Learning models
7. Evaluating Machine Learning models

# An AI solution to diagnose the failure of industrial machines

Most recently, I have been involved in the "Sound of Failure project", where I have developed a solution to diagnosing the failure of industrial machines using their acoustic footprint. The source code can be found in this Github page: https://github.com/wrijupan/DataScience_Projects/tree/master/01sound-of-failure

#### Description
Downtimes due to machine failures is one of the biggest problems that industries face and often downtime comes unplanned. The main idea of this project is to reduce the extremely high downtime costs by an early diagnosis of failing or broken machines by monitoring their sound pattern over time.  

Machines have a certain acoustic footprint in its normal state which is different to that when the machine is malfunctioning. We developed an efficient algorithm to understand such differences without knowing apriori how a broken machine sounds like. I.e. we have taken an unsupervised Deep Learning approach to train our model only on normal machine sounds which then during testing, can detect abnormal machine sounds as anomalies.

For a detailed description and source code of the project, please check the above-mentioned Github link.
